    2. Name your project code file as "cmpe300_mpi_studentid.c" or "cmpe300_mpi_studentid.cpp". ie. cmpe300_mpi_2008123456.c
	4. I will compile your code with mpicc or mpic++ as below:

		> mpicc -o cmpe300_mpi_studentid ./cmpe300_mpi_studentid.c

		or

		> mpic++ -o cmpe300_mpi_studentid ./mpipp_hellcmpe300_mpi_studentid.cpp

		ie. mpicc -o cmpe300_mpi_2008123456 ./cmpe300_mpi_2008123456.c

	5. I will run your code as below with -np parameter:

		> mpirun --oversubscribe -np <P> cmpe300_mpi_studentid <inputfile>

		or

		> mpiexec --oversubscribe -np <P> cmpe300_mpi_studentid <inputfile>

		ie. mpicc --oversubscribe -np 3 cmpe300_mpi_2008123456 ./input.tsv

	9. Project document must have below sections: (details can be found on the professor's page)

		a. Title

		b. Introduction (brief like one small paragraph)

		c. Program execution (how to compile and run your code, write actual commands needed)

		d. Program structure (detailed part, how you handled the parallel programming and messaging to accomplish the given task)

		e. Difficulties encountered (brief like one small paragraph)

		f. Conclusion


You should also mention how you compiled and run your code, which libraries (mpi, open mpi ...) - compilers (gcc, clang ...) and which versions you used.


There are questions about diff helper function.
